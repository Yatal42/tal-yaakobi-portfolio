          From the fast-paced world of TV production to the intricate world of code, my journey has been anything but ordinary. As a computer science graduate, I now channel my creative energy and storytelling skills into software development. My experience working directly with students with disabilities sparked a deep interest in digital accessibilityâ€”a field I hope to contribute to one day. For now, I pour that same passion into building thoughtful, user-centered software.
